          <h2>Vector Calculus Fundamentals</h2>
          <p>Vector calculus extends the concepts of calculus to vector fields. It is crucial for understanding physics, engineering, and computer graphics.</p>
          <h3>Vector Fields</h3>
          <p>A vector field assigns a vector to each point in space. For example, a velocity field describes the velocity of a fluid at every point.</p>
          <p>A 2D vector field is often written as $\\mathbf{F}(x,y) = P(x,y)\\mathbf{i} + Q(x,y)\\mathbf{j}$.</p>
          <h3>Line Integrals</h3>
          <p>A line integral is an integral where the function to be integrated is evaluated along a curve. It can be used to calculate work done by a force field or the mass of a wire.</p>
          <p>The line integral of a scalar function $f(x,y,z)$ along a curve $C$ parameterized by $\\mathbf{r}(t) = x(t)\\mathbf{i} + y(t)\\mathbf{j} + z(t)\\mathbf{k}$ from $t=a$ to $t=b$ is given by:</p>
          $$\\int_C f(x,y,z) \\, ds = \\int_a^b f(\\mathbf{r}(t)) |\\mathbf{r}'(t)| \\, dt$$
          <p>The line integral of a vector field $\\mathbf{F}$ along $C$ is:</p>
          $$\\int_C \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{r} = \\int_a^b \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}(t)) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}'(t) \\, dt$$
          <h3>Green's Theorem</h3>
          <p>Green's Theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve $C$ to a double integral over the plane region $D$ bounded by $C$.</p>
          <p>If $C$ is a positively oriented, piecewise-smooth, simple closed curve in the plane and $D$ is the region bounded by $C$, then for a vector field $\\mathbf{F}(x,y) = P(x,y)\\mathbf{i} + Q(x,y)\\mathbf{j}$ with continuous partial derivatives:</p>
          $$\\oint_C P \\, dx + Q \\, dy = \\iint_D \\left( \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} \\right) \\, dA$$
          <p>This theorem is fundamental for simplifying calculations in 2D vector fields.</p>

          <h2>Surface Integrals and Stokes' Theorem</h2>
          <p>Surface integrals extend line integrals to surfaces. They are used to calculate flux across a surface or the mass of a thin shell.</p>
          <h3>Surface Integrals of Scalar Functions</h3>
          <p>The surface integral of a scalar function $f(x,y,z)$ over a surface $S$ is:</p>
          $$\\iint_S f(x,y,z) \\, dS = \\iint_D f(\\mathbf{r}(u,v)) |\\mathbf{r}_u \\times \\mathbf{r}_v| \\, dA$$
          <p>where $S$ is parameterized by $\\mathbf{r}(u,v)$ and $D$ is the parameter domain.</p>
          <h3>Stokes' Theorem</h3>
          <p>Stokes' Theorem is a generalization of Green's Theorem to higher dimensions. It relates a surface integral of the curl of a vector field to a line integral around the boundary curve of the surface.</p>
          <p>If $S$ is an oriented smooth surface with boundary curve $C$ (a simple, closed, piecewise-smooth curve) and $\\mathbf{F}$ is a vector field whose components have continuous partial derivatives on an open region in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ containing $S$, then:</p>
          $$\\oint_C \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{r} = \\iint_S (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F}) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS$$
          <p>where $\\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector to $S$ and $C$ is traversed in the positive direction relative to the orientation of $S$.</p>
