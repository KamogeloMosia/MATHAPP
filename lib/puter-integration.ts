      problem: `Find the limit: $$\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{3x^2 - 2x + 5}{7x^2 + 4x - 9}$$`,
      answer: "\\frac{3}{7}",
      hint: "Consider the highest power terms in both numerator and denominator as x approaches infinity.",
      solution: `DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION:

Step 1: When finding the limit as x approaches infinity of a rational function, we need to focus on the terms with the highest power of x in both numerator and denominator.

Step 2: In the numerator, the highest power term is 3x². In the denominator, the highest power term is 7x².

Step 3: Divide both numerator and denominator by x² (the highest power):
$$\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{3x^2 - 2x + 5}{7x^2 + 4x - 9} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{3 - \\frac{2}{x} + \\frac{5}{x^2}}{7 + \\frac{4}{x} - \\frac{9}{x^2}}$$

Step 4: As x approaches infinity, the terms with 1/x and 1/x² approach zero:
$$\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{3 - 0 + 0}{7 + 0 - 0} = \\frac{3}{7}$$

Final Answer: The limit equals \\frac{3}{7}`,
